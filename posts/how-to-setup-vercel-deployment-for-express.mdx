This is how I deploy my **Express** app using TypeScript to **Vercel free version**

First, you need to create a new Vercel account and follow the steps to set up your account.

This is how my files structure looks like:

![file-structure](/file-structure.jpg)

Then, you need to create a **vercel.json** file in the root directory of your project (like showed in the image above).

```js
/vercel.json

{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "src/index.ts",
      "use": "@vercel/node",
      "config": { "includeFiles": ["src/**"] }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "src/index.ts"
    }
  ]
}

```

make sure to add environment variables in Vercel dashboard.
