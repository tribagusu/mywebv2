So, I created a simple API that sends an activation email to the user's email address. The user will have to click on the activation link to activate their account.

In this article, I want to share my code on how to setup the Gmail SMTP in Nodemailer for creating user activation API.

## Environment Variables

This is the code for env file

```js
/.env.local

EMAIL_SMTP_SECURE=true
EMAIL_SMTP_PASS="****************"
EMAIL_SMTP_USER="*****@gmail.com"
EMAIL_SMTP_PORT=587
EMAIL_SMTP_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
EMAIL_SMTP_SERVICE_NAME="Gmail"
CLIENT_HOST="http://localhost:3001"
```

The _EMAIL_SMTP_PASS_ you have to put is the 16 digits password of an **Application Specific Password** that you can generate from your Gmail account. You can learn more about how to use Nodemailer with Gmail SMTP from the Nodemailer blog in this link [nodemailer using gmail](https://www.nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/). I recommend you are using 2FA for your Gmail account and generate an **Application Specific Password** for your application. Because using your Gmail password directly in your application is not secure.

If you are not familiar with the **Application Specific Password**, you can follow this link [support.google.com](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) to learn more about it.

## Transporter Object

This is the code for the transporter object

```js
// create configuration for nodemailer transporter object
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  service: EMAIL_SMTP_SERVICE_NAME,
  host: EMAIL_SMTP_HOST,
  port: EMAIL_SMTP_PORT,
  secure: EMAIL_SMTP_SECURE,
  auth: {
    user: EMAIL_SMTP_USER,
    pass: EMAIL_SMTP_PASS,
  },
  requireTLS: true, // Force TLS
  debug: true, // Enable debugging
  logger: true, // Log SMTP communication
});
```

The _requireTLS_ is set to true to force the TLS connection. The _debug_ and _logger_ are set to true to enable debugging and log SMTP communication. If for some reason you encounter an error, you can check the log to see what is happening.
